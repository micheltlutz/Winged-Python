# Winged-Python
# =============

Winged-Python is an innovative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) library for efficient HTML writing in Python. Mirroring its Swift counterpart, Winged-Python is based on the DSL concept, focusing on simplification and specificity in HTML generation. Using the Composite design pattern, the library enables developers to construct HTML structures in a logical, organized, and reusable manner.

This library is created to be fully independent, not requiring integration with specific server frameworks or front-end libraries. This offers developers the freedom to use Winged-Python across a variety of projects, from simple static pages to complex web applications, keeping the code clean, readable, and efficient.
